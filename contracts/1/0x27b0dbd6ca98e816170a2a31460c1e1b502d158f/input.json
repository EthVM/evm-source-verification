don't wander around and get lost.\r\ncontract FadeAwayBunnyCore is FadeAwayBunnyMinting {\r\n\r\n    // This is the main CryptoKitties contract. In order to keep our code seperated into logical sections,\r\n    // we've broken it up in two ways. First, we have several seperately-instantiated sibling contracts\r\n    // that handle auctions and our super-top-secret genetic combination algorithm. The auctions are\r\n    // seperate since their logic is somewhat complex and there's always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping\r\n    // them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks\r\n    // FadeAwayBunny ownership. The genetic combination algorithm is kept seperate so we can open-source all of\r\n    // the rest of our code without making it _too_ easy for folks to figure out how the genetics work.\r\n    // Don't worry, I'm sure someone will reverse engineer it soon enough!\r\n    //\r\n    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major\r\n    // facet of functionality of CK. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still\r\n    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:\r\n    //\r\n    //      - FadeAwayBunnyBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core\r\n    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus\r\n    //             internal functions for managing these items.\r\n    //\r\n    //      - FadeAwayBunnyAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations\r\n    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.\r\n    //\r\n    //      - FadeAwayBunnyOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token\r\n    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).\r\n    //\r\n    //      - FadeAwayBunnyBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed cats together, including\r\n    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.\r\n    //\r\n    //      - FadeAwayBunnyAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on cats or siring\r\n    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one\r\n    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated\r\n    //             through this facet of the core contract.\r\n    //\r\n    //      - FadeAwayBunnyMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 cats.\r\n    //             We can make up to 5000 \"promo\" cats that can be given away (especially important when\r\n    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up\r\n    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they\r\n    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 50k gen0 cats. After that, it's all up to the\r\n    //             community to breed, breed, breed!\r\n\r\n    // Set in case the core contract is broken and an upgrade is required\r\n    address public newContractAddress;\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Creates the main CryptoKitties smart contract instance.\r\n    function FadeAwayBunnyCore() public {\r\n        // Starts paused.\r\n        paused = true;\r\n\r\n        // the creator of the contract is the initial CEO\r\n        ceoAddress = msg.sender;\r\n\r\n        // the creator of the contract is also the initial COO\r\n        cooAddress = msg.sender;\r\n\r\n        // start with the mythical kitten 0 - so we don't have generation-0 parent issues\r\n        _createFadeAwayBunny(0, 0, 0, bytes32(-1), address(0));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// @dev Used to mark the smart contract as upgraded, in case there is a serious\r\n    ///  breaking bug.
