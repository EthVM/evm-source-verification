For example, a single AMM contract can trade all strikes of WBTC/USDC calls\n\nIt uses on-chain Black-Scholes approximation and an Oracle price feed to calculate price of an option.\nIt then uses this price to bootstrap a constant product bonding curve to calculate slippage for a particular trade\ngiven the amount of liquidity in the pool.\n\nExternal users can buy bTokens with collateral (wToken trading is disabled in this version).\nWhen they do this, the AMM will mint new bTokens and wTokens, sell off the side the user doesn't want,\nand return value to the user.\n\nExternal users can sell bTokens for collateral. When they do this, the AMM will sell a partial amount of assets\nto get a 50/50 split between bTokens and wTokens, then redeem them for collateral and send back to the user.\n\nLPs can provide collateral for liquidity. All collateral will be used to mint bTokens/wTokens for each trade.\nThey will be given a corresponding amount of lpTokens to track ownership. The amount of lpTokens is calculated based on\ntotal pool value which includes collateral token, payment token, active b/wTokens and expired/unclaimed b/wTokens\n\nLPs can withdraw collateral from liquidity. When withdrawing user can specify if they want their pro-rata b/wTokens\nto be automatically sold to the pool for collateral. If the chose not to sell then they get pro-rata of all tokens\nin the pool (collateral, payment, bToken, wToken).
