The Rocketeer contract only allows you to spawn one Rocketeer at a time.\r\n               You cannot have enough of them, so this makes it more easy to buy as many as you want!\r\n            2: Saving gas fees. While Rcoketeers themselves are free to spawn, using Ethereum is not. By minting multiple\r\n               NFTs at once, you save about 10-20% per Rocketeer on gas fees.\r\n               But be cautious: Your transactions can still fail if MetaMask gas estimation isn't correct anymore at execution time.\r\n               So make sure to supply enough gas, you'll always get the remainder refunded if it was too much.\r\n            3: Handling the \"42nd-mechanic\" nicely. Every 42nd mint creates two (special!) Rocketeers, one for the user and one for the devs.\r\n               This can result in failed transactions and lost gas. To mitigate this effect, you can specify whether you\r\n               want to mint a 42nd or not.\r\n    @dev Could add some checks to not try minting over max supply of 3475, but this is short lived anyway. Let's save that gas instead.\r\n*/\r\ncontract RocketeerHelper {\r\n\r\n    Rocketeer constant rocketeer = Rocketeer(0xb3767b2033CF24334095DC82029dbF0E9528039d);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n    @notice Try to spawn one Rocketeer.
