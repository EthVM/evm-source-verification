This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it.\n */\ncontract ACLRegistry is IACLRegistry {\n  /* ========== STATE VARIABLES ========== */\n\n  struct RoleData {\n    mapping(address => bool) members;\n    bytes32 adminRole;\n  }\n\n  mapping(bytes32 => RoleData) private _roles;\n  mapping(bytes32 => address) private _permissions;\n\n  bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = 0x00;\n  bytes32 public constant KEEPER_ROLE = keccak256(\"Keeper\");\n  bytes32 public constant DAO_ROLE = keccak256(\"DAO\");\n  bytes32 public constant APPROVED_CONTRACT_ROLE = keccak256(\"ApprovedContract\");\n\n  /* ========== CONSTRUCTOR ========== */\n\n  constructor() {\n    _roles[DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE].members[msg.sender] = true;\n  }\n\n  /* ========== VIEW FUNCTIONS ========== */\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.\n   */\n  function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n    return _roles[role].members[account];\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `permission`.\n   */\n  function hasPermission(bytes32 permission, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n    return _permissions[permission] == account;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @dev Returns the admin role that controls `role`.
