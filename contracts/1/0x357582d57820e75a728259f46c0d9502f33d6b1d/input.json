The Network smart contract does not have a beneficiary or other affiliated persons receiving an individual reward over standart Network marketing.\r\n2.  You can exchange Ethereum (ETH) for Network tokens (NET) only after receiving a registration transfer from the address previously registered on the Network smart contract.\r\n3.  The linking of the subscriber (referral) address is carried out by transferring to it any number of NET, provided that no one has done this yet, and the referral link cannot be changed under any circumstances, except for the situation described in p.4.\r\n4.  Important! If at the time of accrual of the referral reward the balance of the address is less than 0.0625 NET, the referrer address of the referral chain lower address will be replaced with the address of a higher referral chain address. In other words, the subordinate address will be moved to upstream address in the referral chain. This action is irreversible and affects only the referral chain and the associated marketing conditions of the Network smart contract.\r\n5.  The exchange of NET for ETH is carried out by making an ETH deposit to the Network smart contract address and NET issuing.\r\n6.  The minimum exchange amount is 1 GWEI (0.000000001 ETH).\r\n7.  The exchange rate of NET for ETH at the time of exchange is calculated by the formula:\r\n        R = E / S\r\n        where\r\n        R - exchange rate NET for ETH;\r\n        E - the total amount of ETH deposit placed on the balance of the Network smart contract;\r\n        S - the total emission of NET.\r\n8.  At the time of depositing (exchanging) ETH for the Network smart contract, the current rate is calculated and 70% of the received amount is NET issued to the address from which ETH deposit was placed (transferred), and the remaining amount is distributed according to the referral chain ten levels up, starting from 15% for the address of the first level and further with a decrease in the amount of issue and accrual of NET by half at each next level.\r\n9.  To receive a reward from the referral chain, the address balance must have at least 0.0625 NET to receive rewards from the first lower level with a doubling for each subsequent level in depth to the tenth level. Thus, in order to receive a reward from 10 levels, the address must have at least 32 NET. The amount of the referral reward received depends on the balance of the address at the time of calculation. If the balance of the address is greater than or equal to the total potential amount of NET issue according to the placed ETH deposit, the full amount of remuneration is accrued according to the Network marketing, otherwise the remuneration is calculated using the formula:\r\n        R = B / D * E\r\n        where\r\n        R - received remuneration;\r\n        B - address balance;\r\n        D - amount of potentially issued NET per placed ETH deposit;\r\n        E - total amount of remuneration by level according to Network Marketing.\r\n10.  For the missed or reduced reward, NET are not issued, thereby increasing the ratio of the total amount of ETH deposit to the total number of NET.\r\n12.  The reverse exchange (return) of the deposit is carried out by transferring NET to the address of the Network smart contract, while ETH deposit will be returned to the address that sent the tokens at the rate according to the formula specified in p.7.\r\n13.  NET tokens received at the address of the smart contract are destroyed, thereby providing a positive growth trend in the exchange rate of NET for ETH, except for the situation described in p.14.\r\n14.  From the launch of Network smart contract until the total emission of 50 NET is reached, the exchange rate is fixed at 1 NET = 1 ETH by issuing the missed and unreceived reward on the balance of the Network smart contract. When the total token emission of 50 NET is reached, all NET on the balance of the smart contract are destroyed (burned) and a dynamic token exchange rate is established.\r\n15.  Any address that is the only address with a positive NET balance can reset it's balance, the balance of Network smart contract, withdraw all deposited ETH on the smart contract by using RESTART function. In this case, the exchange rate will return to 1:1 and will be fixed until the emission of 50 NET is reached.\r\n17.  For ease of use, the RATE function of smart contract displays the exchange rate of 1 NET for 1 ETH multiplied by 1'000'000 due to the lack of the ability to display floating point numbers in the Ethereum EVM, is for informational purposes only and is not used in calculating actual values within the smart contract marketing and functionality.\r\n18.  NET supports all the generally accepted functions and properties of the ERC20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain, incl. transfers, storage and decentralized applications.\r\n\r\n(c) 2020 PROOF
