\"precision\" is, the more bits are required in order to store this value.\n          And the exponentiation function, which takes \"x\" and calculates \"e ^ x\", is limited to a maximum exponent (maximum value of \"x\").\n          This maximum exponent depends on the \"precision\" used, and it is given by \"maxExpArray[precision] >> (MAX_PRECISION - precision)\".\n          Hence we need to determine the highest precision which can be used for the given input, before calling the exponentiation function.\n          This allows us to compute \"base ^ exp\" with maximum accuracy and without exceeding 256 bits in any of the intermediate computations.\n          This functions assumes that \"_expN < 2 ^ 256 / log(MAX_NUM - 1)\", otherwise the multiplication should be replaced with a
