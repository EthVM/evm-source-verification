Owners of Terraforms NFTs can:\n\n1. Display, reproduce and commercialize the Art (defined below) while they own \nthe NFTs, with optional attribution.\n2. Develop and commercialize derivative works of the Art, both physical and \nvirtual (including, for example, fractionalizations) while they own the \ncorresponding NFTs, with optional attribution.\n3. Continue to commercialize derivative works of the Art of NFTs they previously \nowned if the derivative works were developed and released while they owned the \nNFTs.\n4. Use the Art for personal, non-commercial use.\n5. Display the Art on marketplaces for buying and selling their NFTs.\n6. Use their NFTs to interact with websites and apps, including decentralized \napps (dapps).\n\n### 2.B. Owners of Terraforms NFTs cannot:\n\n1. Transfer the rights granted by this license to anyone, or to the public.\n2. Commercialize the Art of NFTs they do not currently own, or develop or \nrelease derivative works of the Art of NFTs they do not currently own.\n3.
