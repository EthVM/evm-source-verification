The MRV deposit is returned when\n * the owner releases their claim on the corresponding object.\n *\n * The claim system is protected against front-running by a commit/reveal\n * system with a mandatory waiting period. You first commit to the claim you\n * want to make, by putting up the deposit and publishing a hash. After a\n * certain mandatory waiting period, you can reveal what it is you are trying\n * to claim, and actually take ownership of the object.\n *\n * The first person to reveal wins in case two or more people try to claim the\n * same object, or if they try to claim things that are\n * parents/children/overlapping in such a way that the claims conflict. Since\n * there's a mandatory waiting period between the commit and reveal, and since\n * a malicious front-runner cannot commit until they see a reveal they are\n * trying to front-run, then as long as malicious front-runners cannot keep\n * transactions off the chain for the duration of the mandatory wait period,\n * then they can't steal things other people are trying to claim.\n *\n * It's still possible for an organic conflict to end up getting resolved in\n * favor of whoever is willing to pay more for gas, or for people to leave many\n * un-revealed claims and grief people by revealing them when someone else\n * tries to claim the same objects.\n *\n * To further mitigate griefing, committed claims will expire after a while if\n * not revealed.\n *\n * Revealing requires demonstrating that the Macroverse object being claimed\n * actually exists, and so claiming can only be done by people who can pass the\n * Macroverse generator's AccessControl checks.\n *\n * Note that ownership of a star system does not necessarily imply ownership of\n * everything in it. Just as one person can own a condo in another person's\n * building, one person can own a planet in another person's star system.\n * Non-containment of different ownership claims is only enforced for claims of\n * land on planets and moons.\n *\n * The surface of a world is subdivided using a Hierarchical Triangular Mesh\n * approach, as described in <http://www.skyserver.org/HTM/> and in\n * <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/tr-2005-123.pdf>\n * \"Indexing the Sphere with the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh\". At the top\n * level, the surface of a world is an octahedron of equilateral triangles.\n * Each triangle is then recursively subdivided into 4 children by inscribing\n * another equilateral triangle between the center points of its edges. Each\n * HTM \"trixel\" is a plot of virtual real estate that can be claimed. Land\n * trixels can be subdivided and merged, and ownership of a trixel implies\n * ownership of all contained trixels, because this logic can be done without\n * any reference to the AccessControl-protected Macroverse generator logic.\n *\n * The mapping from systems, planets, moons, and land trixels to token ID\n * numbers is defined in the MacroverseNFTUtils library.\n *\n * \"Planets\" which are asteroid belts and \"moons\" which are ring systems also\n * are subdivided into 8 triangles, and then recursively into nested sets of 4\n * sub-triangles. However, the initial 8 triangles are defined as wedges, with\n * the points at the central body and with the outer edges being curved. They\n * are numbered prograde, with the division from 0 to 7 corresponding to the\n * object's notional position, computed as if it were a point body with the\n * same orbital parameters. Note that this means that some ownership claims do\n * not actually overlap the orbital range (and thus do not contain anything),\n * and that any actual particles would move relative to the positions of the\n * claims over time, depending on their actual orbits. \n *\n * At the astronomical level (stars, planets, moons), tokens can be issued\n * for the children of things already claimed, if the lowest owned parent token\n * has homesteading enabled.  At the land level, only one token can cover\n * a given point at a given time, but plots can be subdivided and merged\n * according to the trixel structure.\n *\n * Internally, bookkeeping data is kept to allow the tree of all issued tokens\n * to be traversed. All issued tokens exist in the tree, as well as the\n * internal nodes of the token hierarchy necessary to connect them. The\n * presence of child nodes in the tree is tracked using a bitmap for each node.\n *\n * The deployer of this contract reserves the right to supersede it with a new\n * version at any time, for any reason, and without notice. The deployer of\n * this contract reserves the right to leave it in place as is indefinitely.\n *\n * The deployer of this contract reserves the right to claim and keep any\n * tokens or ETH or contracts sent to this contract, in excess of the MRV\n * balance that this contract thinks it is supposed to have.\n */\ncontract MacroverseUniversalRegistry is Ownable, HasNoEther, HasNoContracts {\n\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n    using MacroverseNFTUtils for uint256;\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    // These constants are shared with the TokenUtils library\n\n    // Define the types of tokens that can exist\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TYPE_SECTOR = 0;\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TYPE_SYSTEM = 1;\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TYPE_PLANET = 2;\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TYPE_MOON = 3;\n    // Land tokens are a range of type field values.\n    // Land tokens of the min type use one trixel field\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TYPE_LAND_MIN = 4;\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TYPE_LAND_MAX = 31;\n\n    // Define the packing format\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SECTOR_X_SHIFT = 5;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SECTOR_X_BITS = 16;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SECTOR_Y_SHIFT = TOKEN_SECTOR_X_SHIFT + TOKEN_SECTOR_X_BITS;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SECTOR_Y_BITS = 16;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SECTOR_Z_SHIFT = TOKEN_SECTOR_Y_SHIFT + TOKEN_SECTOR_Y_BITS;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SECTOR_Z_BITS = 16;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SYSTEM_SHIFT = TOKEN_SECTOR_Z_SHIFT + TOKEN_SECTOR_Z_BITS;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_SYSTEM_BITS = 16;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_PLANET_SHIFT = TOKEN_SYSTEM_SHIFT + TOKEN_SYSTEM_BITS;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_PLANET_BITS = 16;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_MOON_SHIFT = TOKEN_PLANET_SHIFT + TOKEN_PLANET_BITS;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_MOON_BITS = 16;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_TRIXEL_SHIFT = TOKEN_MOON_SHIFT + TOKEN_MOON_BITS;\n    uint8 constant TOKEN_TRIXEL_EACH_BITS = 3;\n\n    // How many trixel fields are there\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TRIXEL_FIELD_COUNT = 27;\n\n    // How many children does a trixel have?\n    uint256 constant CHILDREN_PER_TRIXEL = 4;\n    // And how many top level trixels does a world have?\n    uint256 constant TOP_TRIXELS = 8;\n\n    // We keep a bit mask of the high bits of all but the least specific trixel.\n    // None of these may be set in a valid token.\n    // We rely on it being left-shifted TOKEN_TRIXEL_SHIFT bits before being applied.\n    // Note that this has 26 1s, with one every 3 bits, except the last 3 bits are 0.\n    uint256 constant TOKEN_TRIXEL_HIGH_BIT_MASK = 0x124924924924924924920;\n\n    // Sentinel for no moon used (for land on a planet)\n    uint16 constant MOON_NONE = 0xFFFF; \n\n    //\n    // Events for the commit/reveal system\n    //\n\n    // Note that in addition to these special events, transfers to/from 0 are\n    // fired as tokens are created and destroyed.\n\n    /// Fired when an owner makes a commitment.
