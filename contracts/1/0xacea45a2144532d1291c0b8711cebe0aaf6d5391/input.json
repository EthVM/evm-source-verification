It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initialized;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initializing;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initializer function from being invoked twice.\n     */\n    modifier initializer() {\n        require(_initializing || !_initialized, \"Initializable: contract is already initialized\");\n\n        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\n            _initializing = true;\n            _initialized = true;\n        }\n\n        _;\n\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\n            _initializing = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n// File contracts/ThrTokenTimelock.sol\n\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\n\ncontract ThrTokenTimelock is Initializable {\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    // ERC20 basic token contract being held\n    IERC20 private _token;\n\n    // beneficiary of tokens after they are released\n    address private _beneficiary;\n\n    // timestamp when token release is enabled\n    uint256 private _releaseTime;\n\n    function initialize(\n        IERC20 token_,\n        address beneficiary_,\n        uint256 releaseTime_\n    ) external initializer {\n        require(releaseTime_ > block.timestamp, \"TokenTimelock: release time is before current time\");\n        _token = token_;\n        _beneficiary = beneficiary_;\n        _releaseTime = releaseTime_;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @return the token being held.\n     */\n    function token() public view virtual returns (IERC20) {\n        return _token;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @return the beneficiary of the tokens.\n     */\n    function beneficiary() public view virtual returns (address) {\n        return _beneficiary;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @return the time when the tokens are released.\n     */\n    function releaseTime() public view virtual returns (uint256) {\n        return _releaseTime;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Transfers tokens held by timelock to beneficiary.\n     */\n    function release() public virtual {\n        require(block.timestamp >= releaseTime(), \"TokenTimelock: current time is before release time\");\n\n        uint256 amount = token().balanceOf(address(this));\n        require(amount > 0, \"TokenTimelock: no tokens to release\");\n\n        token().safeTransfer(beneficiary(), amount);\n    }\n}\n\n\n// File contracts/ThrTimelockFactoryClone.sol\n\n\n\npragma solidity 0.8.7;\n\n\n\ncontract ThrTimelockFactoryClone {\n    address immutable tokenTimeLockImplementation;\n\n    event NewTimeLockContract(address indexed tokenTimeLockAddress);\n\n    constructor() {\n        tokenTimeLockImplementation = address(new ThrTokenTimelock());\n    }\n\n    function createTokenTimelock(IERC20 token_,\n        address beneficiary_,\n        uint256 releaseTime_) external returns (address) {\n        address clone = Clones.clone(tokenTimeLockImplementation);\n        ThrTokenTimelock(clone).initialize(token_, beneficiary_, releaseTime_);\n        emit NewTimeLockContract(clone);\n        return clone;\n    }\n}"
