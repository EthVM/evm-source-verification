Reggie provides Vera a public key\r\n * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\r\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\r\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\r\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\r\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\r\n * @dev from the output space.\r\n *\r\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\r\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\r\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness.\r\n * *****************************************************************************\r\n * @dev USAGE\r\n *\r\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\r\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\r\n * @dev shown:\r\n *\r\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\r\n * @dev     constuctor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\r\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) public {\r\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\r\n * @dev       }\r\n * @dev   }\r\n *\r\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\r\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash), and have told you the minimum LINK\r\n * @dev price for VRF service. Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and\r\n * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you\r\n * @dev want to generate randomness from.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\r\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.\r\n *\r\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value\r\n * @dev generated from your seed.\r\n *\r\n * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by\r\n * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent\r\n * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is\r\n * @dev associated with which randomness. See VRFRequestIDBase.sol for more\r\n * @dev details. (See \"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\" for principles to keep in mind,\r\n * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.)\r\n *\r\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\r\n * @dev differ. (Which is critical to making unpredictable randomness! See the\r\n * @dev next section.)\r\n *\r\n * *****************************************************************************\r\n * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\r\n *\r\n * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\r\n * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\r\n * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\r\n * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\r\n *\r\n * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\r\n * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\r\n * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\r\n * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\r\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\r\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\r\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\r\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\r\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\r\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\r\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the\r\n * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact\r\n * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API\r\n * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\r\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\r\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\r\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\r\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\r\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\r\n * @dev cost.
