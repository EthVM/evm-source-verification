Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it.\n */\nabstract contract AccessControl is Context, IAccessControl {\n    struct RoleData {\n        mapping(address => bool) members;\n        bytes32 adminRole;\n    }\n\n    mapping(bytes32 => RoleData) private _roles;\n\n    bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = 0x00;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Emitted when `newAdminRole` is set as ``role``'s admin role, replacing `previousAdminRole`\n     *\n     * `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is the starting admin for all roles, despite\n     * {RoleAdminChanged} not being emitted signaling this.\n     *\n     * _Available since v3.1._\n     */\n    event RoleAdminChanged(bytes32 indexed role, bytes32 indexed previousAdminRole, bytes32 indexed newAdminRole);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Emitted when `account` is granted `role`.\n     *\n     * `sender` is the account that originated the contract call, an admin role\n     * bearer except when using {_setupRole}.\n     */\n    event RoleGranted(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Emitted when `account` is revoked `role`.\n     *\n     * `sender` is the account that originated the contract call:\n     *   - if using `revokeRole`, it is the admin role bearer\n     *   - if using `renounceRole`, it is the role bearer (i.e. `account`)\n     */\n    event RoleRevoked(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier that checks that an account has a specific role.
