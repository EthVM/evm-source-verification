This situation can occur\n     *      because we do not segregate reward balances by window, for code simplicity purposes.\n     *      (If `rewardsToDeposit` is purposefully insufficient to payout all claims, then the admin must\n     *      subsequently transfer in rewards or the following situation can occur).\n     *      Example race situation:\n     *          - Window 1 Tree: Owner sets `rewardsToDeposit=100` and insert proofs that give claimant A 50 tokens and\n     *            claimant B 51 tokens. The owner has made an error by not setting the `rewardsToDeposit` correctly to 101.\n     *          - Window 2 Tree: Owner sets `rewardsToDeposit=1` and insert proofs that give claimant A 1 token. The owner\n     *            correctly set `rewardsToDeposit` this time.\n     *          - At this point contract owns 100 + 1 = 101 tokens. Now, imagine the following sequence:\n     *              (1) Claimant A claims 50 tokens for Window 1, contract now has 101 - 50 = 51 tokens.\n     *              (2) Claimant B claims 51 tokens for Window 1, contract now has 51 - 51 = 0 tokens.\n     *              (3) Claimant A tries to claim 1 token for Window 2 but fails because contract has 0 tokens.\n     *          - In summary, the contract owner created a race for step(2) and step(3) in which the first claim would\n     *            succeed and the second claim would fail, even though both claimants would expect their claims to succeed.\n     * @param rewardsToDeposit amount of rewards to deposit to seed this allocation.\n     * @param rewardToken ERC20 reward token.\n     * @param merkleRoot merkle root describing allocation.\n     * @param ipfsHash hash of IPFS object, conveniently stored for clients\n     */\n    function setWindow(\n        uint256 rewardsToDeposit,\n        address rewardToken,\n        bytes32 merkleRoot,\n        string memory ipfsHash\n    ) external onlyOwner {\n        uint256 indexToSet = nextCreatedIndex;\n        nextCreatedIndex = indexToSet.add(1);\n\n        _setWindow(indexToSet, rewardsToDeposit, rewardToken, merkleRoot, ipfsHash);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Delete merkle root at window index.\n     * @dev Callable only by owner.
