Elemental base cards are sold weekly, allowing only the most skilled alchemists to thrive and progress in this medieval metaverse. All NFT holders will receive ETHEREUM yield generated by the game ecosystem, rewarding the most loyal and skilled holders.\r\n\r\nNFT & Token\r\nDeflation System\r\nMelee Game leverages a brand new type of NFT minting process that balances game design and scarcity, designed to produce a sustainable, long-term economy. Crafting Technology achieves this, in part, by burning base cards to craft higher-tier cards, combing scarcity with game theory. Additionally, when chests are opened with $MELEE, they are both burnt and used for vital liquidity--bolstering the entire game economy. The NFT’s total supply will be determined and balanced by community demand driven by free market principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Source\r\nCrafting Technology\r\nMelee Game leverages the ERC-1155 protocol and the Crafting System is rooted in the features available within this specification. This system can be utilized by any project, partner or artist to generate a sustainable NFT economy driven by actual demand, not arbitrary numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard Game\r\nMelee Game’s play-to-earn board game mode allows players to go head-to-head, testing their skills and demonstrating the strength of their alchemy and crafted power. This is an engaging game experience, bringing the NFT crafting and economy to life in an all out medieval battle. A successful victor earns ETHEREUM rewards, generated by the game protocol.\r\n\r\n《MELEE Land》\r\nMELEE game UI，Based on the MELEE contract, you can summon heroes, assign points, go on an adventure, and upgrade levels.\r\n\r\n《MELEE Dungeons》\r\nMELEE Of Dungeons is the first exploration based on d20srd rules in the MELEE game ecosystem. Get more assets in adventure.\r\n\r\n《Melee Game》\r\nMelee Game is monster collections in MELEE ecosystem, 11000 in total, with attributes randomly created.\r\nHow are black hole contracts applied to project iterations?\r\n\r\nWith the emergence of projects, there will be situations where the old contracts are gradually not applicable to the new scenarios. Different from the traditional Internet system, the biggest derivation problem is how to transfer the assets in the old contract to the new contract.\r\nA set of black hole contracts without management authority can be developed. Assets can only be entered but cannot be exported. Asset recovery is undertaken for the old contract, and the new contract is mapped at the same time, thereby completing the transfer of values and assets.\r\nBut there is a problem. The solution requires the user to initiate the initiative, and the old users who have not received the message cannot complete the work.\r\nWhat the key requirements of smart contracts are\r\nflexibility and scalability\r\nWhen designing, it is necessary to split the value storage function and the business execution function. The iteration of the business contract does not affect the value and assets of the storage contract, which can effectively reduce the cost of iteration. And there is no need for users to actively do any work. As shown in the figure below: Xcontract is a business contract, AssetBox is a storage contract, and the iteration of X does not affect the data.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade Melee Game 1.0 to 2.0\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Melee Game 1.0\r\nThe total amount of Melee Game 1.0 is 11,000.\r\nMelee Game Instruction\r\nMelee Gameis a kind of NFT asset randomly generated and stored on the blockchain with different names, careers, and…\r\nmedium.com\r\n\r\nAt first, we developed the Battle smart contract for Rarity. After realizing that there were no monsters in the game, we designed and developed the Melee Game. Then we have to optimize the Battle contract to fit in Melee Game. After all the back and forth, our goal is getting clear, an RPG game, DnD alike, but in monsters’ prospective.\r\nReasons for the upgrade\r\nTwo keys:\r\nThere are only 11.000 monsters in Melee Game 1.0, which is not conducive to the development of the game ecosystem. The so-called scarcity lays in demand, not in quantity. In order to promote the healthy development of the game and attract more players to participate in the game, and create a metaverse from the perspective of Monster, We decided not to limit the quantity.\r\nThere are lots of shortcomings in Melee Game 1.0 on the road of continuous exploration, such as, limited gameplay experience, character attributes mismatch due to unfamiliarity with DnD. We did experice the pleasure brought by the game after doing lots of homework (reading books, watching videos, and participating in games). We really want to bring this pleasure to more DnD players, which drives us to dedicate more to the game. This all starts from the upgrading.\r\nWhat is Melee Game 2.0\r\nContracts fully based on DnD3.5E standard, which means normalized description of monsters, standardized character attributes, etc. The structure of contracts:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Planning of Melee Game 2.0\r\nCompared with 1.0, a more flexible architecture will be adopted, which will separate data, storage, and management. With this architecture, Apps is for minting, MonsterBox is for bookkeeping, and DAO is for management.\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function totalSupply()
